# TIPE_project
TIPE project aiming to resolve the following problem : to what extent is wearing a bicycle helmet useful for an entire population ? 

The goal is to answer this problematic using machine learning, and thus finding if modifying some parameters such as "the helmet is mandatory" or "the helmet is not advised to be worn while cycling" have any impact on the number of deaths or injuries caused by cycling.

A TIPE is a project made during 2 years in the CPGE in France, where the goal is, at the end of the 2 years, to explain the reasonings and choices made to find the best solution for the initial problematic. 

Thematic of this year : sanity, prevention

Any help to explain how to use keras or pytorch, or to explain why a solution might be better than another one is welcome !
